# Sales and Marketing Data Science

## **Movie Recommendation System (Deep Learning)**  
   - **Overview:** This project involves building a content-based recommendation system for movies. It utilizes TensorFlow to model user preferences and suggest relevant movies.
   - **Technology Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
   - **Dataset:** [Movies Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/faiqueali/tensorflow-movie-recommender-system)

## **Telco Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning/Predictive Modeling)**
   - **Overview:** Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn can help businesses proactively address customer concerns and retain clients, which is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will churn based on their demographics and usage patterns using machine learning techniques. Additionally, we'll identify key factors that influence churn. 
   - **Technology Stack:** Python, pandas, Numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
   - **Dataset:** [Customer Churn Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhartiprasad17/customer-churn-prediction)
   - **Output:** [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Fuady/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Customer_Telco_Churn_Prediction.ipynb)

## **NLP Sentiment Analysis of EasyJet Reviews (Web-scraping, Deep Learning, Machine Learning/Predictive Modeling)**
   - **Overview:** This project analyzes customer sentiment toward EasyJet based on reviews collected from Trustpilot. Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the sentiment of the reviews is classified into positive and negative categories. The project also compares three machine learning and deep learning models—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)—to identify the most effective approach for sentiment classification.
   - **Technology Stack:** Python, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, Numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
   - **Dataset:** [EasyJet reviews on Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.easyjet.com)
   - **Output:** [Sentiment Analysis of EasyJet Reviews](https://github.com/Fuady/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Sentiment_analysis_easyjet.ipynb)

# Financial Data Science

## **TSLA Stock Analysis (Web-scraping, Deep Learning, Machine Learning/Predictive Modeling)**
   - **Overview:** This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Tesla (TSLA) stock using various data science techniques, including data scraping, visualization, stock prediction using neural networks and creating a signal for buy/sell stock based on MACD.
   - **Technology Stack:** Python, yfinance, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn, tensorflow, pandas, Numpy
   - **Dataset:** [TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)
   - **Output:** [TSLA Stock Analysis Project](https://github.com/Fuady/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Stock_analysis.ipynb)

## **Car Insurance Fraud Detection (Machine Learning/Predictive Modeling)**
   - **Overview:** This project involves analyzing insurance claims data to detect fraudulent activities. By leveraging machine learning models and exploratory data analysis, the goal is to identify key patterns and characteristics of fraudulent claims.
   - **Technology Stack:** Python, pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
   - **Dataset:** [Auto Insurance Claims Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/buntyshah/auto-insurance-claims-data)
   - **Output:** [Car Insurance Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Fuady/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Car%20Insurance%20Fraud%20Detection.ipynb)

## **Travel Insurance Prediction (Machine Learning/Predictive Modeling)**
   - **Overview:** This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will purchase travel insurance based on their demographic and travel-related information. The objective is to build a predictive model and analyze key factors influencing the purchase decision. 
   - **Technology Stack:** Python, pandas, Numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, SHAP, scikit-learn
   - **Dataset:** [Travel Insurance Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/travel-insurance-prediction-data)
   - **Output:** [Travel Insurance Prediction](https://github.com/Fuady/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Travel_insurance_prediction.ipynb)

# Others

## **League of Legends Win Prediction(Machine Learning/Predictive Modeling)**  
   - **Overview:** This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of winning in a ranked League of Legends match. Using player performance statistics and match data, a machine learning model is built to classify match outcomes. The analysis and model leverage a dataset of over 180,000 ranked games, making it a rich resource for exploration and prediction. 
   - **Technology Stack:** Python, pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
   - **Dataset:** [League of Legends Ranked Matches Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paololol/league-of-legends-ranked-matches)
   - **Output:** [League of Legends Win Prediction](https://github.com/Fuady/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/LoL_prediction.ipynb)

## **Fetal Health Classification (Machine Learning/Classification)**
   - **Overview:** Fetal health classification is critical in obstetrics to ensure proper care and intervention during pregnancy. The goal of this analysis is to classify the health status of a fetus into one of three categories, i.e. Normal, Suspect, Pathological. Using clinical features such as fetal heart rate patterns and other indicators, we aim to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts these categories. 
   - **Technology Stack:** Python, pandas, Numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
   - **Dataset:** [Fetal Health Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/karnikakapoor/fetal-health-classification)
