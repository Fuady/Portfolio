# Portfolio
Greetings! My name is Angga, and I'm excited to share my still developing data analytics and engineer portfolio. Within this repository, you'll find a comprehensive catalog of projects completed in various data analytics/engineering courses or self development exercises, each of which covers essential skills and techniques.

## **Movie Recommendation System**  
   - **Overview:** This project involves building a content-based recommendation system for movies. It utilizes TensorFlow to model user preferences and suggest relevant movies.
   - **Technology Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
   - **Dataset:** [Movies Dataset from Kaggle](link-to-dataset)
   - **Output:** [Movie Recommendation System]()

 ## **Car Insurance Fraud Detection**  
   - **Overview:** This project involves analyzing insurance claims data to detect fraudulent activities. By leveraging machine learning models and exploratory data analysis, the goal is to identify key patterns and characteristics of fraudulent claims.
   - **Technology Stack:** Python, pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
   - **Dataset:** [Auto Insurance Claims Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/buntyshah/auto-insurance-claims-data)
   - **Output:** [Car Insurance Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Fuady/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Car%20Insurance%20Fraud%20Detection.ipynb)

## **League of Legends Win Prediction**  
   - **Overview:** This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of winning in a ranked League of Legends match. Using player performance statistics and match data, a machine learning model is built to classify match outcomes. The analysis and model leverage a dataset of over 180,000 ranked games, making it a rich resource for exploration and prediction. 
   - **Technology Stack:** Python, pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SHAP, XGBoost
   - **Dataset:** [League of Legends Ranked Matches Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paololol/league-of-legends-ranked-matches)
   - **Output:** [League of Legends Win Prediction]()

## **CO2 Dashboard**  
   - **Overview:** This project involves creating an interactive dashboard to analyze CO2 emissions data globally and regionally. Using visualization tools, the dashboard provides insights into CO2 emissions trends, GDP per capita, and other related metrics for various countries. 
   - **Technology Stack:** Python, pandas, Numpy, Panel, Bokeh, HvPlot
   - **Dataset:** [Our World in Data CO2 Emissions Dataset](https://github.com/owid/co2-data)
   - **Output:** [CO2 Dashboard]()
